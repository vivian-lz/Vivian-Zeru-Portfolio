# PortfolioWebsite

This is my first deployed website, which was done through Vercel and is linked here: 
https://vivianzeruportfolio.vercel.app/home

I wanted to create my own portfolio to show my work to recruiters as I apply to internships, but I also hope that anyone interested enjoys seeing the projects I work on and how much I like to create and build through this website!

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.0.
This website was also built using the assistance of YouTube tutoirals from the "Software Engineering Skills" YouTube channel and was debugged with the assistance of 
prompt engineering with AI tools. However, everything else was created utilizing ideas and inspiration I had from doing website development in my Summer 2024 SWE Internship at UPS. 

The icon images on the Contact page (the first three from left to right) were found on Google, but every other image on the website is either my own or designed by me using Canva. 

Thank you for being interested in my work and visiting my site, and let me know if you have any questions!
