    <p>
        Whether you are a friend, teacher, mentor, recruiter, 
        or seeing me for the first time, welcome and
        thank you for visiting my page! I was inspired by my 
        Summer 2024 SWE internship doing website and application 
        development to make this, and a year later, I finally made the
        time to create the final product and deploy it! I hope that 
        this website showcases my skills, excitement, and passion
        for learning new things and exploring all aspects of tech. 
        Enjoy!
