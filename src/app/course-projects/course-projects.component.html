            VLSI Design Project (ECE 5385 - Fall 2025)</b>
    </div>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
     Currently, I am working on my final project for this course (individually since I am taking the course for 
     graduate credit). I am designing an 8-bit booth multiplier.
     <br>
     Our most recent finished project involved creating a 4-Bit Counter using passgates and clocked inverters.
     This project also included the consideration and study of setup and hold timing. While it was not graded on doing this, I 
     took the inititave of simulating the exact setup and hold time of my counter using the parametric analysis feature in 
     Cadence Virtuoso.
     <br>
     For another project, we designed a 4-Bit Multiplier utilizng 
     4 half-adders and 8 full-adders, which is typically the final project for most university classes but 
     we are completing in a week, showcasing the large technical aptitude in a short amount of time. Previously, 
     we have also created NAND, NOR, INV gates as well as a half-adder, full-adder, 2-bit adder, and a 4-bit adder.
     For each assignment, we have done the following in Cadence Virtuoso using an AWS VM:
     <li>Schematic Design</li>
     <li>ADL Simulation in HSPICE and Simulation Schematic Design</li>
     <li>Layout Design</li>
     <li>Full Physical Verification checks, including
      DRC (Design Rule Checks)
      LVS (Layout Versus Schematic)
      PEX (Parasitic Extraction)
     </li>
     <li>Pre and Post Layout Simulation</li>
     <li>All projects utlized a 45 nm node technology with a 10 track design on the standard cell gates.</li>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our final project in this course will likely be a 2-month project to design an 8-bit 
     booth multiplier, but will be confirmed later in the semester. In this project, the 4 main constraints of IC 
     design will be explored in more rigour: area, speed, power, reliability. (So far, area has only been explored 
     to limited depth).

    This project involves using the Polulu 3pi+ robot to design a maze solver algorithm in my team of 3 that can successfully solve 
    a maze using the left turn method as well as create a remembering algorithm to allow the robot to remember how it previously 
    solved the maze so that it makes zero mistakes on its second pass of the same maze. This is done using the MicroChip Studio IDE, 
    is programmed in C, and utilizings our knowledge on previously creating a line follower algorithm with the IR sensors and motors that 
    are embedded into this robot.

            <b>Syringe Pump Project (DF 2100 - Fall 2024)</b>
        </div>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our final project in Rapid Prototyping (where
        DF stands for Digital Fabrication in the course code title)
        was to create a device that can push a 
        20 mL and 10 mL syringe utilizing a stepper motor and linear actuator. 
        I worked in a team with myself and three other people to create this device, 
        where our team was called the "Gantry Gang" (given by our professor).
        We designed our own enclosure using Fusion 360 and 3D printed the 
        components out of PLA. The linear actuator also had 3D printed components made 
        of PLA and ABS (for the motor mount). The device was programmed using 
        an Arduino IDE as it runs on an Arduino Uno microcontroller to create 
        position reset buttons, have a potentiometer to select a flow rate between 0.1 
        and 5 mL/min, an LCD that displays all of this information, a limit switch that 
        detects how much liquid is in the device, an RGB light that flashes red, 
        yellow, or green to show the status of the device, and a power button for the 
        device. In addition, there is a power supply within the device tiself that 
        allows it to completely run on its own by being plugged into the wall 
        with an outlet plug.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My main contribution to this project was on the ECE side, as I 
        helped wire up the Arduino together with the breadboard and helped 
        do a lot of the coding of the Arduino Uno Microcontroller.

        <b>Weather Station (Project-Based Programming - HS Senior Year)</b>
    </div>
    <p>
        I created a portable weather station in my Project-Based programming 
        class (senior year of high school) using an Arduino Uno and coding on 
        Arduino IDE software that is connected to an LCD and uses RGB lighting 
        and a BME 280 sensor. This device displays the temperature, humidity, 
        pressure, and approximate altitude in the air on the LCD. The device 
        also uses a RGB LED to indicate how hot or cold the weather is through 
        six different color ranges based on the temperature reading (using 
        general known indication where red is the hottest temperature and blue 
        is the coldest with four other colors in between accordingly). Finally, 
        the device is enclosed in a 3D printed case that I created and rendered 
        using OpenSCAD software. I presented each iteration of this project to 
        my class and have tweaked it over the course of a school year before I 
        reached its final product.
