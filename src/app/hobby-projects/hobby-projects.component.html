        I have always enjoyed tinkering with devices and electronic parts
    since the moment I decided I wanted to be an engineer at age 11.
    As a result, I have tinkered with many devices including 
    Arduinos, Raspberry Pis, and I also recently was gifted an 
    STM32 that I hope to tinker with as well to make my own projects
    with!
    <br>
    <br>
    (Note that both of these projects are to be completed, 
     and I hope to do them this summer.)

     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>ALU</b>
     <p>
        <li>
            This is an 4-bit ALU designed using two different methods: by using cases to build a 
            1-bit ALU and use that to scale up to a 4-bit ALU with interfaces and by utilizing the 
            hardware structure of an ALU that is defined by a full adder and multiplexer. This ALU 
            has a 2-bit opcode, or ALUControl that can compute Add, Subtract, AND, and OR functions.
            The add and subtract functions are created utilizing twos complement.
            <br>
            Current Progress: While I have limited HDL and Verilog knowledge from digital systems coursework, 
            I have been expanding my knowledge by using the hdlbits website to practice Verilog, as shown here: 
            <a href="https://github.com/vivian-lz/verilog_hdlbits_highlights">GitHub Repo</a>. 
            I have currently created the full method using cases and interfaces, and am working on the 
            structural hardware method. I hope to use my Verilog concepts learned from this more basic 
            project to complete more advanced Verilog work in the future.

        <li>
            Designing a PCB in Eagle that uses an ESP32 and BME280 
            sensor to display the temperature, humidity, pressume, and approximate altitude on an 
            LCD while using an RGB LED to visually display the temperature as well.
            trends.
            <br>
            Current Progress: I created this in high school using an Arduino Uno. Now, I have made this 
            project more advanced by designing the PCB in Eagle that uses an ESP32 module instead. 
            I am in the process of learning to gain more control over the BME280 communication protocols 
            by utilizing I2C communication through an STM32 Nucelo-64. In the future, I would like to use 
            Verilog to create the sensor and control the communication even more. I also would hope to design 
            the PCB using the raw ICs in the future, and also get the PCBs manufactured to assemble a full 
            working product.

     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Plant Health Monitoring Device (In Progress)</b>
     <p>
        <li>
            Designing a PCB in Eagle that uses an ESP32, soil moisture, BME280 
            temperature and humidity sensor, and BH1750 light sensor to monitor 
            plant health. Will have 2 LEDs that indicate if the plant needs more light 
            or more water. In the future, may try to add ML processing that 
            predicts how long the plant can go without water based on previous 
            trends.
            <br>
            Current Progress: PCB is built to support sensor and ESP32 modules. I will 
            build a new PCB that supports the raw ICs of these components to 
            decrease space as well and will assemble both versions of the device.

        <li>
            Utilizing a Raspberry Pi 4 Module B gifted to me from a professor as well as 
            a motion sensor and Raspberry Pi Camera Module 2 to create a device that 
            can detect a person who comes up to the area being monitored and 
            can capture who the person is. In the future, AI may be used to do image 
            processing and detect who the person is.
            <br>
            Current Progress: Electronics are assembled and code is being worked on in 
            Python on the Raspberry Pi (firmware).
