        I have always enjoyed tinkering with devices and electronic parts
    since the moment I decided I wanted to be an engineer at age 11.
    As a result, I have tinkered with many devices including 
    Arduinos, Raspberry Pis, and I also recently was gifted an 
    STM32 that I hope to tinker with as well to make my own projects
    with!
    <br>
    <br>
    (Note that both of these projects are to be completed, 
     and I hope to do them this summer.)

     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Plant Health Monitoring Device (In Progress)</b>
     <p>
        <li>
            Designing a PCB in Eagle that uses an ESP32, soil moisture, BME280 
            temperature and humidity sensor, and BH1750 light sensor to monitor 
            plant health. Will have 2 LEDs that indicate if the plant needs more light 
            or more water. In the future, may try to add ML processing that 
            predicts how long the plant can go without water based on previous 
            trends.
            <br>
            Current Progress: PCB is built to support sensor and ESP32 modules. I will 
            build a new PCB that supports the raw ICs of these components to 
            decrease space as well and will assemble both versions of the device.

                <p>This is how the PCB for the module implementation will look like once manufactured 
                    through JLCPCB. The rendering was created in Eagle.

     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Raspberry Pi: AI-Enabled Security System (In Progress)</b>
     <p>
        <li>
            Utilizing a Raspberry Pi 4 Module B gifted to me from a professor as well as 
            a motion sensor and Raspberry Pi Camera Module 2 to create a device that 
            can detect a person who comes up to the area being monitored and 
            can capture who the person is. In the future, AI may be used to do image 
            processing and detect who the person is.
            <br>
            Current Progress: Electronics are assembled and code is being worked on in 
            Python on the Raspberry Pi (firmware).
