        I have always enjoyed tinkering with devices and electronic parts
    since the moment I decided I wanted to be an engineer at age 11.
    As a result, I have tinkered with many devices including 
    Arduinos, Raspberry Pis, and I also recently was gifted an 
    STM32 that I hope to tinker with as well to make my own projects
    with!

     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>4-Bit ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)</b>
     <p>
        <li>
            This is an 4-bit ALU designed using two different methods: by using cases to build a 
            1-bit ALU and use that to scale up to a 4-bit ALU with interfaces and by utilizing the 
            hardware structure of an ALU that is defined by a full adder and multiplexer. This ALU 
            has a 2-bit opcode, or ALUControl that can compute Add, Subtract, AND, and OR functions.
            The add and subtract functions are created utilizing twos complement digital logic. This 4-bit ALU
            also includes a testbench that works for either design due to proper encapsulation.
        </li>
            <br>
        <li>
            While I have limited HDL and Verilog knowledge from digital systems coursework, 
            I have been expanding my knowledge by using the hdlbits website to practice Verilog, as shown here: 
            <a href="https://github.com/vivian-lz/verilog_hdlbits_highlights">GitHub Repo</a>. 
        </li>
            <li>This entire project is completed (including the created testbench).</li>
            <br>
            <li>
                The testbench was simulated in EDA Playground with Synopsys VCS, showcasing a 6.74% decrease in CPU time (runtime) for the 
                structural design methodology (0.430 s) versus the behavorial methodology (0.460 s).

     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Modified Weather Station (In Progress)</b>
     <p>
        <li>
            Designing a PCB in Eagle that uses an ESP32 and BME280 
            sensor to display the temperature, humidity, pressume, and approximate altitude on an 
            LCD while using an RGB LED to visually display the temperature as well.
            trends.
        </li>
        <br>
        <b>Features</b>
        <li>ESP32 IC acts as the main chip/microcontroller of this device with the BME280 IC creating the weather station capabilities.</li>
        <li>Uses I2C communication between the microcontroller and the BME280</li>
        <li>Powered through charging with a USB-C port that is powered on 5 V</li>
        <li>Board runs on 3.3 V power</li>
        <li>5-3V LDO to regulate voltage between ESP32 and USB-C connector</li>
        <li>Utilizes a crystal (40 kHz) as the main clock of the ESPS32 and the device itself.</li>
        <li>Includes a reset button to manually prevent freezing issues with the ESP32 IC.</li>
        <li>RGB LED displays 6 colors to visually represent the temperature, while an LCD display visually shows the user the temperature, humidity, pressure, and approximate altitude given by the BME280.</li>
        <li>Firmware to run on the ESP32 microcontroller is created in C++ utilizing the Arduino IDE.</li>
        <li>Schematic takes advantage of decoupling and load capacitors as well as pullup, pulldown, and current-limiting resistors, with a total of 13 of each.</li>
        <li>Layout utilizes differential routing and matches the routing for high speed signals like the differential 
            pairs for the USB-C and the I2C SDA/SCL lines.
        </li>
            <br>
            Current Progress: 
            <li>I created this in high school using an Arduino Uno. Now, I have made this 
            project more advanced by designing the PCB in Eagle that uses an ESP32 instead. </li>
            <li>I already completed the version that utilizes the ESP32 and BME280 modules, but not the raw ICs. I designed it in Eagle 
                and have not yet ordered it through JLCPCB for manufacturing and to assemble the device, but this will be done in the future.
            </li>
            <li>I am currently working on finishing the IC version, which is described below: </li>
            <li>I have created the schematic for the board, utilizing an LDO, USB-C connector, USB to Serial Chip, ESP32 IC, 
                BME280, Crystal to control the clock of the ESP32, reset button to control the ESP32 in case of freezing, an RGB 
                LED as in the previous version, and an LCD as in the previous version to display the temperature, humidity, pressure, 
                and approximate altitude.
            </li>
            <li>I am currently working on the board, which right now is expected to result in a 24.73% decrease in area 
                compared to the version utilizing the modules. (4401.71mm2 versus 3432.93mm2)
            </li>
            <li>I am also in the process of learning to gain more control over the BME280 communication protocols 
            by utilizing I2C communication through an STM32 Nucelo-64. In the future, I would like to use 
            Verilog to create the sensor and control the communication even more. I also would hope to get the PCBs manufactured to assemble a full 
            working product.</li>

     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Plant Health Monitoring Device (In Progress)</b>
     <p>
        <li>
            Designing a PCB in Eagle that uses an ESP32, soil moisture, BME280 
            temperature and humidity sensor, and BH1750 light sensor to monitor 
            plant health. Will have 2 LEDs that indicate if the plant needs more light 
            or more water. In the future, may try to add ML processing that 
            predicts how long the plant can go without water based on previous 
            trends.
            <br>
            Current Progress: PCB is built to support sensor and ESP32 modules. I will 
            build a new PCB that supports the raw ICs of these components to 
            decrease space as well and will assemble both versions of the device.

            Utilizing a Raspberry Pi 4 Module B gifted to me from a professor as well as 
            a motion sensor and Raspberry Pi Camera Module 2 to create a device that 
            can detect a person who comes up to the area being monitored and 
            can capture who the person is. In the future, AI may be used to do image 
            processing and detect who the person is.
            <br>
